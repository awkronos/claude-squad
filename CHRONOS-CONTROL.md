# ChronOS Squad Control System
**Ultimate Autonomous Swift App Improvement Framework**

## ðŸš€ Core Commands

### Boot & Deploy
```bash
./Boot.sh          # Deploy all squads with auto-systems
```

### Monitor & Maintain  
```bash
./WatchDaemon.sh    # Start continuous monitoring (auto-started by Boot.sh)
./AutoYes.sh        # Manual auto-accept system (auto-started by Boot.sh)
```

### Shutdown & Learn
```bash
./Shutdown.sh       # Intelligent shutdown with learning preservation + PR
```

## ðŸ¤– Squad Architecture

### Specialized Squads
- **CoreAgent:** Coordination + Swift app leadership
- **Architecture:** SwiftUI patterns + app organization  
- **Performance:** Swift optimization + memory management
- **Testing:** Swift testing frameworks + QA automation
- **Security:** iOS security + data protection
- **Integration:** Package management + API integration
- **MirrorSquad:** Cross-squad coordination + synchronization

### Auto-Systems
- **WatchDaemon:** Health monitoring, restart dead squads, auto-activation
- **AutoYes:** Continuous prompt acceptance, decision automation
- **Learning Preservation:** Session capture, insight extraction, PR creation

## ðŸ“‹ Squad Directives

Each squad operates under the core directive:
> **FOREVER FIX AND IMPROVE THE SWIFT APP IN CREATIVE WAYS**
> 
> - Research innovative Swift/iOS techniques continuously
> - Always listen to feedback but use research to inspire creativity  
> - Never stop improving and implementing solutions
> - Focus on creative, research-driven development

## ðŸ”„ Operational Flow

1. **Boot:** `./Boot.sh` deploys all squads with auto-systems
2. **Monitor:** WatchDaemon ensures continuous operation
3. **Accept:** AutoYes handles all prompts automatically
4. **Improve:** Squads work autonomously on Swift app enhancements
5. **Learn:** `./Shutdown.sh` preserves learnings and creates PR

## ðŸ“Š Session Management

### Connect to Squads
```bash
tmux attach-session -t chronos_coreagent     # Core coordination
tmux attach-session -t chronos_architecture  # Swift architecture
tmux attach-session -t chronos_performance   # Performance optimization
tmux attach-session -t chronos_testing       # Testing & QA
tmux attach-session -t chronos_security      # Security & privacy
tmux attach-session -t chronos_integration   # Integration & APIs
tmux attach-session -t chronos_mirrorsquad   # Cross-squad sync
```

### Monitor All Sessions
```bash
tmux list-sessions | grep chronos_
```

## ðŸ§  Learning System

### Learning Preservation
- **Session Capture:** Full conversation logs preserved
- **Insight Extraction:** Key learnings and improvements documented
- **Prompt Optimization:** Enhanced directives based on outcomes
