## Next Generation Prompt Suggestions
Based on this session's learnings, the following prompt optimizations are recommended:

1. **Enhanced Research Integration:** [To be filled by squad analysis]
2. **Creative Problem Solving:** [To be filled by squad analysis] 
3. **Feedback Integration Patterns:** [To be filled by squad analysis]
4. **Swift-Specific Optimizations:** [To be filled by squad analysis]
