# Claude Squad [![CI](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/smtg-ai/claude-squad)](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/releases/latest)

[Claude Squad](https://smtg-ai.github.io/claude-squad/) is a terminal app that manages multiple [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) (and other local agents including [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)) in separate workspaces, allowing you to work on multiple tasks simultaneously.

### Highlights
- Complete tasks in the background (including yolo / auto-accept mode!)
- Manage instances and tasks in one terminal window
- Review changes before applying them, checkout changes before pushing them
- Each task gets its own isolated git workspace, so no conflicts
- Automatic git synchronization keeps your branches up-to-date with main
- Cross-agent synchronization for coordinated multi-agent workflows
- Submodule support with automatic updates

### Installation

The easiest way to install `claude-squad` is by running the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stmg-ai/claude-squad/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will install the `cs` binary to `~/.local/bin` and add it to your PATH. To install with a different name, use the `--name` flag:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stmg-ai/claude-squad/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --name <n>
```

Alternatively, you can also install `claude-squad` by building from source or installing a [pre-built binary](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/releases).

### Prerequisites

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing)
- [gh](https://cli.github.com/)

### Usage

```
Usage:
  cs [flags]
  cs [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  debug       Print debug information like config paths
  help        Help about any command
  reset       Reset all stored instances
  sync        Sync git repositories with main and update submodules
  version     Print the version number of claude-squad

Flags:
  -y, --autoyes          [experimental] If enabled, all instances will automatically accept prompts for claude code & aider
  -h, --help             help for claude-squad
  -p, --program string   Program to run in new instances (e.g. 'aider --model ollama_chat/gemma3:1b')
```

Run the application with:

```bash
cs
```

<b>Using Claude Squad with other AI assistants:</b>
- For [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex): Set your API key with `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>`
- Launch with specific assistants:
   - Codex: `cs -p "codex"`
   - Aider: `cs -p "aider ..."`
- Make this the default, by modifying the config file (locate with `cs debug`)

#### Menu
The menu at the bottom of the screen shows available commands: 

##### Instance/Session Management
- `n` - Create a new session
- `N` - Create a new session with a prompt
- `D` - Kill (delete) the selected session
- `↑/j`, `↓/k` - Navigate between sessions

##### Actions
- `↵/o` - Attach to the selected session to reprompt
- `ctrl-q` - Detach from session
- `s` - Commit and push branch to github
- `c` - Checkout. Commits changes and pauses the session
- `r` - Resume a paused session
- `?` - Show help menu

##### Navigation
- `tab` - Switch between preview tab and diff tab
- `q` - Quit the application
- `shift-↓/↑` - scroll in diff view

### How It Works

1. **tmux** to create isolated terminal sessions for each agent
2. **git worktrees** to isolate codebases so each session works on its own branch
3. A simple TUI interface for easy navigation and management
4. **Automatic synchronization** to keep branches up-to-date with main branch
5. **Submodule support** for working with complex repository structures
6. **Cross-agent communication** for coordinated multi-agent workflows

### Git Synchronization

Claude Squad supports automatic git synchronization to keep your branches up-to-date with the main branch and update submodules. This can be configured in the settings or used on-demand:

```bash
# Sync a specific instance
cs sync my-instance-name

# Sync all instances
cs sync --all

# Sync with specific options
cs sync --all --pull-main --update-submodules --auto-resolve

# Check sync status
cs debug
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

Claude Squad supports communication between different agent instances, allowing them to:

1. Share context and state information
2. Coordinate on complex tasks
3. Avoid duplicating work
4. Pass information between specialists

This enables powerful workflows where multiple agents can work together on different aspects of the same project, with automatic synchronization between their workspaces.
